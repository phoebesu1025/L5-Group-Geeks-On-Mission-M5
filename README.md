<p>The aim for the project was to enhance the user experience on Metro Property Management website. (<a href="https://metronz.co.nz">https://metronz.co.nz/</a>).
Collaborated with 2 UX designers and another developer, we applied Agile methodology with daily stand-up meetings. </br></br>
Base on the Figma prototype redesigned by my designer partner, we completed most of the frontend feature for the website, and I completed the search filter function with frontend and backend in Property Manager search page, and my project partner Karan Singh had completed the mapping function and search filter function in Property Listing Page</P>
